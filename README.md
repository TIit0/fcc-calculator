My free code camp calculator challenge! i tried to make it as close as it could to the FCC calculator, I had to go back a few times as i tested and discovered how the FCC one worked, i left the old logic in the boneyard file. 
i know Js has an eval function but i feel i wouldn't have learned as much going that way and i love learning :D
it was very fun i learned a lot of stuff HUAAAAAA!  (that's me making a flexing noise).
